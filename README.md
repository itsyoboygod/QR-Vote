# QR Vote

A blockchain-inspired voting system that uses QR codes to encode votes and stores the vote chain in a GitHub Gist for transparency and immutability.

## Overview

QR Vote allows users to cast votes, generate QR codes representing those votes, and maintain a tamper-evident chain stored in a GitHub Gist. Each vote is linked via SHA-256 hashes, and QR codes can be scanned to verify the data. The system is designed for educational or small-scale voting use cases.

## Features

- Generates QR codes for each vote with encoded JSON data.
- Stores the vote chain in a GitHub Gist (vote_chain.json).
- Validates chain integrity using SHA-256 hashing.
- Scans QR codes to confirm vote data.
- Supports command-line or interactive vote input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (recommended 3.8 due to current setup, though upgrading to 3.10+ is advised).
- System Dependencies: libzbar0 for QR code scanning.
- GitHub Account: For Gist storage (requires a Personal Access Token with gist scope).

## Setup

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

- Run the following commands:
  - git clone <repository-url>
  - cd qrvote

### 2. Install System Dependencies

- On Ubuntu-based systems, execute:
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install libzbar0

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

- Create and activate the virtual environment with:
  - python3 -m venv qrvote_env
  - source qrvote_env/bin/activate

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

- Install required packages with:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a .env file in the project root by running:
  - touch .env
- Add your GitHub Personal Access Token with the following content:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
  - GIST_FILENAME=vote_chain.json
  - GIST_DESCRIPTION=QR Vote Blockchain MVP
- Ensure the token has gist scope (generate via GitHub settings under Developer settings).

## Usage

### Run the Script

- Activate the virtual environment:
  - source qrvote_env/bin/activate
- Cast a vote with a command-line argument:
  - python src/qrvote.py "YES"
- Or run interactively (prompts for input):
  - python src/qrvote.py

### Expected Output

For the first vote (genesis block):
- New vote added:
  - {
    "vote": "YES",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-11T11:07:00.123456",
    "prev_hash": "genesis_hash",
    "hash": "a1622f0b3f59353b39ee8bb7cca9a377576228b03957ee83b28a356822a3a8ef"
    }
- QR code saved as: qrcodes/vote_a1622f0b.png
- Updated Chain Gist URL: https://gist.github.com/username/1234567890abcdef
- Chain validation: Chain is valid
- Scanned QR code data:
  - {
    "vote": "YES",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-11T11:07:00.123456",
    "prev_hash": "genesis_hash",
    "hash": "a1622f0b3f59353b39ee8bb7cca9a377576228b03957ee83b28a356822a3a8ef"
    }

Subsequent votes will link to the previous blockâ€™s hash.

### Verify the Chain

- Check the Gist URL in the output to view the vote_chain.json file.
- Scan the generated QR code (e.g., with a smartphone app) to confirm the data.
